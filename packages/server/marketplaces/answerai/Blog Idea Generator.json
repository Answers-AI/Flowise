Analyze the source data, blog variables, and keywords/themes.\n2. Create connections between these elements to form unique and relevant blog topics.\n3. Ensure that each idea aligns with the overall context and target audience.\n4. Generate at least 5 distinct blog ideas, but aim for 7-10 if possible.\n5. Make sure each idea is specific enough to be actionable but broad enough to allow for creative writing.\n\nPresent your blog ideas in the following format:\n<blog_ideas>\n1.

Becca glad you could make it.\n\n2\n00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.130\nBen Leiner: hey, Brad?\n\n3\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.250\nBrad Taylor: How's it going.\n\n4\n00:01:42.338 --> 00:01:49.109\nBen Leiner: It's going well, we've got. Becca's on the call. She's a contractor who works with us on design.\n\n5\n00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.469\nBen Leiner: Just another set of another set of eyes. For for what we're working on today.\n\n6\n00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.350\nBrad Taylor: Awesome great to meet you, becca.\n\n7\n00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:04.040\nbecca ray: Hey? You, too. I'm sorry in advance. If I have some Internet issues, I'm happy. But excited to be a part of this.\n\n8\n00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.690\nBen Leiner: I've seen your name on slack for a long time, but have you? And I actually met.\n\n9\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:18.069\nbecca ray: We? What did we do? We had a brainstorm session together. But that was a probably a couple of months ago.\n\n10\n00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.240\nBen Leiner: Okay. Well.\n\n11\n00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.010\nbecca ray: Yeah.\n\n12\n00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.369\nBen Leiner: Nice to meet you again.\n\n13\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.230\nbecca ray: Yeah, you too.\n\n14\n00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:31.480\nBen Leiner: I, I typically run product marketing and consumer insights. So this project at the website is a little out of my lane.\n\n15\n00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:35.792\nBen Leiner: As Brad's heard me say a million times. I'm approaching it with the\n\n16\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:45.510\nBen Leiner: with the attitude of Mel Gibson in any one of his war movies just basically running at it with a spear and trying to not get stabbed too many times by by, you know.\n\n17\n00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.860\nBen Leiner: internal politics or ignorance, or any of these other things, so glad you can be here to to help us fly right.\n\n18\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.820\nBrad Taylor: So, yeah.\n\n19\n00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.920\nMichelle Villasenor: This is the house, the Lego House, where he stole a bunch of Legos and.\n\n20\n00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.240\nBen Leiner: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n21\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.310\nBrad Taylor: Yeah, it's a, it's kind of more. My vision board. I definitely wanna have a wall like this, especially for my kids.\n\n22\n00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.495\nBrad Taylor: Oh, one day. But yeah, I love Legos love just building things that way.\n\n23\n00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.399\nBen Leiner: There was, there was a new story that we mocked up for our social media that involved a guy stealing just a shitload of Legos.\n\n24\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.450\nBen Leiner: So so the the inside joke was that that person was you.\n\n25\n00:03:27.838 --> 00:03:31.859\nBen Leiner: and and you know, given the philosophy of Route last Rev. Perhaps it could be.\n\n26\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.700\nBrad Taylor: Right. That's great how to send me that story.\n\n27\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:51.389\nBrad Taylor: Excellent. So from our end, we also have Max and Louis. So Max is actually our head of engineering and runs all of our engineering team and his partner, Louis, actually has been doing design with us for the last 3 years and\n\n28\n00:03:51.854 --> 00:04:03.670\nBrad Taylor: has developed our design and component library. Throughout the history of the company. And yeah, love to introduce. Yeah, wanna introduce yourself.\n\n29\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.089\nMax Techera: Nice to meet you all, Louis.\n\n30\n00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.060\nBrad Taylor: Yeah.\n\n31\n00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:19.720\nBrad Taylor: excellent. Yeah. And then Max is just yeah. He's he's gonna be. You'll be working with him a lot more when you're in the implementation phase when Adam and Max and\n\n32\n00:04:20.148 --> 00:04:42.380\nBrad Taylor: mainly their team is gonna be doing all the implementation. So the goals of today? So we've gone through. And you know, we have our last Rev. Starter design component library. What we've done is we've put in what we had for the Logos, the different colors, and kind of just put that in there.\n\n33\n00:04:42.698 --> 00:05:09.131\nBrad Taylor: Just for a light touch. And really, the goal of this meeting is to go over everything that's in this Sigma file. Get Michelle and Becca into the figma file, working with Louie to now say, okay. Now that we have this in here, it has our, you know, basic branding stuff. Now, let's, you know, really. Now start to do some revs on it for you know, making the design modern and you know, ready to go\n\n34\n00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:20.460\nBrad Taylor: so feel free to ask any questions. It's a pretty in depth figma file. But yeah would love to. If you have any questions, just let me know.\n\n35\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.090\nBrad Taylor: So 1st off\n\n36\n00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.910\nBrad Taylor: actually, while I'm doing this, Max, can you invite Becca and Michelle to this Sigma file.\n\n37\n00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.740\nMax Techera: Good thing.\n\n38\n00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.750\nBrad Taylor: Yeah.\n\n39\n00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.620\nMax Techera: You will please post your emails, the chat.\n\n40\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:06:04.755\nBrad Taylor: Alright. So the very 1st thing we do when we engage with a new client is 1st start with the design system, I'm sure you, you can appreciate, you know, having a good design system. Having a good Lego box from the beginning is is very important to ensuring that you have design consistency across.\n\n41\n00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:26.137\nBrad Taylor: you know. Right now, we're talking about just the marketing website, a lot of our clients. They use these this component library for a lot of other sites like help centers and internets and things like that. So we try to build it in a way that is scalable and reusable for the future. So that when you need to new, build new pages, new designs? You can say, okay, what?\n\n42\n00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:36.560\nBrad Taylor: Using the analogy again, Legos, do I have right now? Can I build what I want to build with that great? No developer or Hey, we actually have this really cool campaign going out.\n\n43\n00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:56.799\nBrad Taylor: We only have to build that one little piece, and that's kind of the flexibility of this design framework is that you know, you kind of get the the the easy things out of the box. And then you know, that allows you to spend your time. Really thinking of the new design patterns and new components that really bring, you know, the smart news brand to life.\n\n44\n00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:19.060\nBrad Taylor: So so we break it into in this this file has, what we have what we call our Adams. So these are the basic basic building blocks of it. So you have your Logos, your colors, your typography. The different effects styles the icon, the iconography that you have and your buttons, and then how it sits on the grid system.\n\n45\n00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:33.470\nBrad Taylor: then we have what are called molecules. So this is, these are the things that are made up of the atoms. So, for instance, cards is made up of images, you know, ctas and buttons you have forms, and you have inputs of that.\n\n46\n00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:55.580\nBrad Taylor: Then you have, you know, kind of what we call organisms, which is basically collections, new groups, tabs and then different templates, and kind of these all build off of each other ultimately, till you get to pages, which is what you then, you know, see on the web page but they're all built off of these design components.\n\n47\n00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:05.770\nBrad Taylor: And then, of course, we have some guidelines in there, too, around, like image and aspect ratio styles and the different file components. So any questions on that for\n\n48\n00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.760\nBrad Taylor: move on.\n\n49\n00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.080\nBrad Taylor: Alright.\n\n50\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:27.288\nBrad Taylor: So the very 1st page on this is kind of like the guidelines. And this is really meant, you know, we we use this in the discovery, but it's also best, if, too, if you know post discovery, this is kind of used and and and made an integral part of your design process. And when we're actually creating new pages, new\n\n51\n00:08:28.143 --> 00:08:31.320\nBrad Taylor: well, depending new new design components, I should say\n\n52\n00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:59.530\nBrad Taylor: so. There's some instructions in here on editing the components and figma. So we have a concept of what are called master components. And this is designed in a way, so you can change it in one place, and when you're building your pages, when you're building, when you see the different variations of those components, you don't have to change it in a bunch of different ways. And we can walk through like doing that. In in a in a separate training session.\n\n53\n00:09:01.187 --> 00:09:11.250\nBrad Taylor: Yeah. Yeah. So like, for instance, here, you know, adding a media components. It has some instructions here. Where your local styles are are located.\n\n54\n00:09:12.366 --> 00:09:13.600\nBrad Taylor: And then\n\n55\n00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.449\nBrad Taylor: some information about like aspect. Ratio.\n\n56\n00:09:18.431 --> 00:09:23.370\nBrad Taylor: So just some just general figma guidelines across these different places.\n\n57\n00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:44.950\nBrad Taylor: So then, we start into the individual elements. So we start 1st with your logo. So here you can access. You know your assets folder. So wherever you end up housing your final assets, it's good to have that final link so that anyone can get there and get the final assets. Icons, fonts, things like that, and back and forth\n\n58\n00:09:45.100 --> 00:10:02.440\nBrad Taylor: we have kind of. Then we talk about like, what's primary. What's the inverse? We go a lot we do dig, and you'll see, especially in the colors area. We think a lot about like Ada. Compliance and things like that. To make sure that we're that your your sites, you know, up to standards\n\n59\n00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:11.190\nBrad Taylor: so different usages from square around. You know any other usages that you may wanna, you know, create. We could add those here, too.\n\n60\n00:10:11.595 --> 00:10:21.360\nBrad Taylor: Spacing around, you know, what's the clear space look like? And the different types of variants on different, maybe background colors or imagery things like that?\n\n61\n00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:29.590\nBrad Taylor: And then, of course, any notes, and then the master component is down here that you could then edit these things.\n\n62\n00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:42.530\nBrad Taylor: So then we get into the colors. So we put in your brand colors here. So looking at the different primary, the secondary and tertiary colors.\n\n63\n00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:56.889\nBrad Taylor: We have a color combination based off of that based off of viewability. So background, foreground, color combinations. To ensure. You know, these are the right contrast that you would use when\n\n64\n00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.250\nBrad Taylor: you know.\n\n65\n00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:07.269\nBrad Taylor: putting these different together. So even though we have different. You know these colors, there's different shades of it. So we kind of give you that full spectrum of how these could be used\n\n66\n00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:17.080\nBrad Taylor: typography. So once again, we try to keep everything. So it's very standardized.\n\n67\n00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:28.919\nBrad Taylor: We give the basic. You know, this is our basic typography, the fonts, the weights, the heights, the spacings and the different used cases that these fonts are used in.\n\n68\n00:11:29.443 --> 00:11:39.066\nBrad Taylor: This is the basic out of the box. Of course, there may be, you know, cases where maybe an H. 2, because it's in a card looks a little different, and we'll start to identify those different things\n\n69\n00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:46.237\nBrad Taylor: and what those styles are. But this would be where you would see your different you know,\n\n70\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.259\nBrad Taylor: typography and the different use cases as we start to build out those use cases there.\n\n71\n00:11:53.510 --> 00:12:04.479\nBrad Taylor: effect styles. Pretty basic right now. This would be where we house all of the different effects styles that we end up having from like hover effects to. In this case we just have, like, what is the shadow? And\n\n72\n00:12:04.856 --> 00:12:15.249\nBrad Taylor: you know, look like on the different variants for different effect styles so we try to keep this pretty light right now in the beginning, and that you know a lot of what\n\n73\n00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.975\nBrad Taylor: we'll be doing. The design is kind of adding some of these effect styles and making it\n\n74\n00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.000\nBrad Taylor: pop, as people like to say\n\n75\n00:12:23.857 --> 00:12:32.790\nBrad Taylor: so then we have our iconography. Do we ever get the final icons? I know there was some back and forth on that.\n\n76\n00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.779\nMax Techera: Those are the ones that are wearing the.\n\n77\n00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.649\nBen Leiner: We did.\n\n78\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.700\nMax Techera: Bite.\n\n79\n00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:48.180\nMax Techera: but the above one were they should be updated.\n\n80\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.860\nMichelle Villasenor: Okay, I'll look at the\n\n81\n00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.130\nMichelle Villasenor: email.\n\n82\n00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.400\nMichelle Villasenor: 'kay.\n\n83\n00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:03.104\nBrad Taylor: So we'll definitely show the different iconography in this piece, too. So we have the the assets. But this is.\n\n84\n00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:15.740\nBrad Taylor: you know, once again, a very important part of the design libraries. You know the iconography, how you're using it when you're using it. Cta, usage, nav usage other usage of like cards and things like that.\n\n85\n00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.589\nBrad Taylor: yeah. And then the different sizes.\n\n86\n00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:50.260\nBrad Taylor: and we go into buttons. So the whole main ctas of what you have on your site. So out of the box. We have different variants for our different buttons, and you'll see this come up now that we're getting into the more we're we're we're moving up. So we have contained, which is just, you know, basic contained. We have corner rounded, we have outlined and outlined round it. And you know, different text.\n\n87\n00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.580\nMax Techera: It could.\n\n88\n00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.170\nMax Techera: Bree.\n\n89\n00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.020\nMax Techera: There's some default\n\n90\n00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.210\nMax Techera: autumns.\n\n91\n00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.959\nBrad Taylor: The default. Buttons.\n\n92\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:06.520\nMax Techera: Yeah, I was looking at the current site, and I was trying to\n\n93\n00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.930\nMax Techera: date a bit\n\n94\n00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.760\nMax Techera: to define the this time for the book\n\n95\n00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.579\nMax Techera: got it? Let's see.\n\n96\n00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.961\nBrad Taylor: Yeah, so yeah, trying to. Yeah.\n\n97\n00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:24.530\nBrad Taylor: yeah, I get well on this one, too. When we have the containment button corner contained around, we would then style this, you know\n\n98\n00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:37.559\nBrad Taylor: we're doing on the current. But we would style this so that these variants and then in the Cms you can choose which one. And also okay, can infer which one to use depending on. If it's being used in a card.\n\n99\n00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.610\nBrad Taylor: a list, a different component things like that. So\n\n100\n00:14:42.223 --> 00:14:51.926\nBrad Taylor: and we can add different button and Cta styles as well, too. And you can kind of see some of these like, for instance, the app download we've added\n\n101\n00:14:52.628 --> 00:15:02.739\nBrad Taylor: for yours. And then also, you know, text no padding and different areas. So we'll continue if we have other Ctas, and how links look on the site.\n\n102\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.209\nMax Techera: Just just small comment on on this as we go through these different\n\n103\n00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:13.930\nMax Techera: files. You see there, maybe a lot of things, or maybe not enough for your site.\n\n104\n00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:21.750\nMax Techera: This is our base starters. This are where we start now. What we're going to go through in the next few weeks of finding out what of this?\n\n105\n00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:26.859\nMax Techera: But we want which ones we don't want, and where we kind of find that Martin is\n\n106\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.390\nMax Techera: brand.\n\n107\n00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.660\nMax Techera: Now.\n\n108\n00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:30.215\nBrad Taylor: Yeah.\n\n109\n00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:42.259\nBrad Taylor: yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And really, the goal of this kind of jump start this. And really, you know, take advantage of everything we've learned over the last 5 years of building these component based design sites.\n\n110\n00:15:43.021 --> 00:15:48.960\nBrad Taylor: So the grid system, very important in terms of your spacing. I think you know.\n\n111\n00:15:49.200 --> 00:16:08.080\nBrad Taylor: I I think this team will appreciate. I think spacing is a is an under appreciated piece of the design aesthetics but is very important, and how all of these fit on a grid and and in ensuring that the responsiveness and it looks great in all of the different styles.\n\n112\n00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:17.370\nBrad Taylor: So there's the 1st part before I get into the next kind of like as we start to talk about the any parts, about kind of like the building blocks. So so far.\n\n113\n00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:36.630\nBrad Taylor: So now we get into the different variations of the different things. So one big piece that is that, the site is made up of our cards, we see cards and blogs, we see cards and people. We see cards and value prop like icons and things like that. So\n\n114\n00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.177\nBrad Taylor: you know, one of the things that's\n\n115\n00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.485\nBrad Taylor: we\n\n116\n00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.360\nBrad Taylor: we see.\n\n117\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:53.530\nBrad Taylor: yeah, you will get comments access if we give back comment, access for sure on that right now. There.\n\n118\n00:16:54.070 --> 00:17:09.379\nBrad Taylor: but but yeah. So we we go through and we decide variance. And from a design perspective. You know we have. And we put in here what can be available. So, for instance, avatar overlaying title, body copy, Cta.\n\n119\n00:17:10.073 --> 00:17:28.289\nBrad Taylor: all of these components will have those. So it's kind of, you know, those are your building blocks. Say, okay, how do I use these 5 data points? 6 data points to then make a card. We have our basic ones like, Hey, a circle profile. We have, you know, testimonial where it might be over here a little bit.\n\n120\n00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:36.809\nBrad Taylor: but they're all just rearranging the same kind of, you know, text fields in different ways. So this is a pricing\n\n121\n00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:49.900\nBrad Taylor: one. This is just, you know, some icons. This is using more of a rich media instead of just an image. This is using the image, but it also has a byline for like author and the month and date.\n\n122\n00:17:50.601 --> 00:17:56.860\nBrad Taylor: You also have horizontal ones that fill up the entire space, perhaps, or maybe multiple cta\n\n123\n00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:13.758\nBrad Taylor: a cards. We also have logo cards. So this would be, how you do Logos of like black and white? This so that. Yeah. You then create these kind of cards that have different aspects. So like, for instance, this one's still a card, but it's just using just the image.\n\n124\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:20.849\nBrad Taylor: So lots of flexibility. But usually cards are groups. That are done in collections.\n\n125\n00:18:23.413 --> 00:18:36.186\nBrad Taylor: Well, it's been too much. This is just a list of all the different inputs. So this is how we start styling your forms and the different pieces there. Right now, we have the main inputs in the search for that. But if\n\n126\n00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.840\nBrad Taylor: we have other fields that we need to do as well, then we can.\n\n127\n00:18:42.248 --> 00:18:51.500\nBrad Taylor: So this is just those forms kind of put together. So you know, either having the form and kind of how it looks like on the wide side by side.\n\n128\n00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:59.730\nBrad Taylor: or on mobile, and also what it would look like, for instance, like an email or just a single single one.\n\n129\n00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:17.641\nBrad Taylor: Then we get into collections, which is another major piece of particular websites. So now that you have these cards or these different elements? You know, how do you put these on there? So this is one example. We have a quote item that you can do like a carousel of quotes.\n\n130\n00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:23.712\nBrad Taylor: You have, these cards, where which are usually used for like blogs, or just\n\n131\n00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:31.449\nBrad Taylor: calling out different pieces where you have a list where you can have like 2, you know, or you know, 3. You can have rich media.\n\n132\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:44.729\nBrad Taylor: and what they kind of look like with 3, 4, 2, or just one on the different card styles. You can see kind of what they look like in logo carousels, as you can see, this has this, you can kind of see full\n\n133\n00:19:45.073 --> 00:19:59.299\nBrad Taylor: outputs. And all of these, what I'm gonna be doing is putting these in as templates. So that when you're creating new content. These are kind of like your starting points, and then you can just update them. As you go.\n\n134\n00:20:01.143 --> 00:20:19.699\nBrad Taylor: There's also, for instance, here, different, using different image heights for different, like image carousels. Maybe you want full. So these are like a lot of the different ways you can do collections which I don't think most of what we talked about. There wasn't anything that wouldn't fit in this area.\n\n135\n00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:28.055\nBrad Taylor: Then we go into navigation. So this is kind of the different ways that that\n\n136\n00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:42.410\nBrad Taylor: yeah, outside of just even the header and footer. But like just navigating the site. So, for instance, pagination breadcrumbs at the top, we're gonna have bread crumbs navigation groups. So like, Hey, when you have a\n\n137\n00:20:42.843 --> 00:20:48.899\nBrad Taylor: dropdowns and nested links. What does that look like? What does the you know? Horizontal\n\n138\n00:20:49.383 --> 00:21:02.456\nBrad Taylor: for categories or navigation groups look like? This is for you know, typically used on blogs. Looks like what we showed yesterday, where you have a search and maybe a few dropdowns for categories.\n\n139\n00:21:03.184 --> 00:21:13.546\nBrad Taylor: What does that look like. And what does that filtering capabilities? Sometimes you have a nav, or you want like a hero with, like a, you know, centered navigation with different things.\n\n140\n00:21:14.255 --> 00:21:18.099\nBrad Taylor: So you know, if you if that component and what that looks like.\n\n141\n00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.290\nBrad Taylor: and then the master components here.\n\n142\n00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:31.638\nBrad Taylor: then, we have a different type of collection. So these are like collections of collections, so to speak. And typically where you see that are in\n\n143\n00:21:32.956 --> 00:21:34.410\nBrad Taylor: tabs. So\n\n144\n00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:45.079\nBrad Taylor: you have a tab of different, maybe card groups. Right? So this is a collection of cards. So you have, you know, 4 different collections of those cards.\n\n145\n00:21:45.534 --> 00:21:57.370\nBrad Taylor: Another good example of this are accordions. So this is just another way of displaying collections and contents. This shows both of them in the same kind of component there.\n\n146\n00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:09.280\nBrad Taylor: So let me get into another core piece, which are blocks. Most websites are made up of blocks. So think of, you know.\n\n147\n00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:18.085\nBrad Taylor: some content on the left something on the right. Right? So a lot of different variations here. This will be a lot of where you kind of spend.\n\n148\n00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:41.400\nBrad Taylor: I think a a great deal. There's a lot of flexibility in this of what type of media we can put on there from masking to the ways that you even, do you know, background colors and making them go together with background images. But here's just a couple of just examples of just difference, you know side by side, maybe add an accordion with a call out at the bottom.\n\n149\n00:22:41.901 --> 00:22:49.920\nBrad Taylor: you know, here's 1 with a card that just has an accordion, or, you know, just listing text with a Cta\n\n150\n00:22:50.305 --> 00:23:04.059\nBrad Taylor: here's another one where it just has a block of listing where it just lists a bunch of items. Maybe a good example of this might be the job postings. Maybe that's more of the accordion. But you have options.\n\n151\n00:23:05.007 --> 00:23:14.390\nBrad Taylor: Yeah. And then these different types of blocks are also very easy. So, for instance, you may see here that we have a block newsletter. Right? Well.\n\n152\n00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:28.825\nBrad Taylor: you know, one way you can do, and that's the flexibility versus the you know, ease of use is that sometimes, even though you saw that on the forms like in order to create like a a brand new section.\n\n153\n00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:45.440\nBrad Taylor: you'd have to create like, maybe 4 or 5 content types in there, cause it's so nested. So when we say, like, you know what I just want a newsletter one, we'll just create as a block variance. So it's all pre configured for you. Right? So it's using the same components, same front end. But we're gonna make it easy for you so that\n\n154\n00:23:45.440 --> 00:24:03.470\nBrad Taylor: when you select it, if it's a common component that you're using. We'll put that usually in the block. So it's less configuration. But having the ultimate configuration, let you experiment with putting different Lego blocks together and then saying, Oh, I like this. Let's save it for a new variation.\n\n155\n00:24:05.854 --> 00:24:14.359\nBrad Taylor: Yeah. And then just different things from blocks from even just plain text with tags, and just a lot of different variations of this.\n\n156\n00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:24.360\nBrad Taylor: Then we have footers and headers. So standard footer. You know, links social logo.\n\n157\n00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:42.669\nBrad Taylor: not too much out last. I have that same thing with the header you know, being able to display. You know what the header looks like, and both you know all the mobile devices what the menu looks like. How nested the menu right now, I think it's just gonna be a basic menu at this point.\n\n158\n00:24:43.956 --> 00:24:47.529\nBrad Taylor: But we'll put in all of the header there\n\n159\n00:24:49.380 --> 00:25:11.360\nBrad Taylor: and then heroes. So these are typically above the fold on landing pages things like that. You know what's the what's and this is a little bit different. Sometimes there's overlap between blocks and sections. But really, this is once again a kind of more helper. A lot of you know, landing pages. They have some major thing that they wanna have at the top. We call it the hero\n\n160\n00:25:11.664 --> 00:25:22.559\nBrad Taylor: that you have lots of different things. Maybe you just wanna have text within there. Maybe you wanna have side by side with a Cta or and these can all be images or videos or forms, or\n\n161\n00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.399\nBrad Taylor: yeah, anything else?\n\n162\n00:25:25.166 --> 00:25:31.043\nBrad Taylor: And then we show the different color combinations you could use with that and some of these\n\n163\n00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:38.760\nBrad Taylor: coming down. And as we think about different hero variations and different use cases, we'll build off this as well.\n\n164\n00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:50.989\nBrad Taylor: and then use of modals. So if there's any, gonna be any use of modals, we'll have these styled in there for different use, cases for forms, for\n\n165\n00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.010\nBrad Taylor: additional information.\n\n166\n00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.330\nBrad Taylor: things like that.\n\n167\n00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.199\nBrad Taylor: Any questions before I get into pages\n\n168\n00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.890\nBrad Taylor: and the building blocks.\n\n169\n00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.800\nBrad Taylor: Huh?\n\n170\n00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:15.519\nBrad Taylor: So Louie went through, and we've done an audit of your current pages right now. I know that right now we this is kind of what we have off. So we have, you know, from the about\n\n171\n00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:22.100\nBrad Taylor: leadership press release an individual article, publishers, page\n\n172\n00:26:22.463 --> 00:26:33.136\nBrad Taylor: the advertising page, the advertising audience, and all the different links to the pages as well, just so that we could get kind of a vision board of like what you currently have.\n\n173\n00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:44.829\nBrad Taylor: And you know where we're going. It's always good to see like, Hey, this is where we were. And now this is where you know we are now as we do it, so that will be our next step.\n\n174\n00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:48.700\nBrad Taylor: Is that we're gonna start taking\n\n175\n00:26:48.900 --> 00:27:00.818\nBrad Taylor: a lot of these different components that we put in here and starting to build out what those new pages look like in here, and that would be the next step. Is that\n\n176\n00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.579\nBrad Taylor: well, we're working through?\n\n177\n00:27:04.712 --> 00:27:07.737\nBrad Taylor: you know the design pieces working through.\n\n178\n00:27:08.622 --> 00:27:10.737\nBrad Taylor: You know, when Louise, you know.\n\n179\n00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:34.899\nBrad Taylor: hey, yeah, working on the design. What we wanna have is like your team in there giving feedback on the design, but also starting to use this sigma file to, you know, use the components. Use the master components to then build these pages, because that's when you're gonna see like when it all put together like, oh, this, it's easier to edit the text. It's easier, probably, for you to work in.\n\n180\n00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:50.069\nBrad Taylor: and then that can help us. Then collaborate cause, you know. When you actually see these, you know components put together and see how they look like all put together, there might be a padding adjustments. You know, there's a lot of things that we can look at, and it's.\n\n181\n00:27:50.070 --> 00:28:11.790\nBrad Taylor: you know, as designers here. So it's a little bit easier working. And then the closer that we have to what those final pages are gonna look like in our development. That also then helps ensure that there's not as much back and forth in the Qa process, because we have like real content that we're using in there. We have designs that have been.\n\n182\n00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:20.180\nBrad Taylor: you know, meticulously looked at and all different aspect ratios using those components built together. So\n\n183\n00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.750\nBrad Taylor: yeah, that's that's where we're at\n\n184\n00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:27.200\nBrad Taylor: questions.\n\n185\n00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:55.168\nMichelle Villasenor: No, I think this seems really straightforward. I think there's just like some nuances going through like as you were going through it, like, I know, there's probably more of a priority on some like color palettes or just elements that we'd probably want to include in some of these templates. But that's something that we can go through. And just like leave comments. Just to make sure that those are represented. But this is very\n\n186\n00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:16.020\nMichelle Villasenor: standard and appreciate you doing all the work to to put this together. And I love seeing where we are currently all in one place. I think it also make it easy to reference back to just so we can kinda see like what's really needed. And what's just something we can make into something else. So thank you for for doing that.\n\n187\n00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:25.180\nBrad Taylor: Awesome. Yeah. And if you have any other like pigmas or anything you're working on, too. We wanna figure out how we can incorporate this stuff into there. Please.\n\n188\n00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.120\nMichelle Villasenor: Yeah, yeah, like.\n\n189\n00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:32.770\nBrad Taylor: Let us know. I'm sure you know you have the zone files. But yeah, we want to collaborate with you. So we're kind of helping with that.\n\n190\n00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:57.729\nMichelle Villasenor: I was gonna say, me becca and another designer got together a couple of days ago and did sort of a a similar audit with all things design. And we kind of dumped everything into a jam board. And we're trying to streamline the brand, look and feel based off of the new brand direction. It's only been in existence the new brand direction for a couple of months since.\n\n191\n00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:21.809\nMichelle Villasenor: So we've just been exploring different avenues on how to bring that to life. And I think from that we were kind of realizing, like what works and what doesn't work and put together kind of like a core mood board, which we are then going to kind of tweak and update and add some like new things to the guideline. So I have one of our other designers. Kind of, you know, putting more color. And I think to\n\n192\n00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:46.169\nMichelle Villasenor: what it is we're trying to achieve visually as a brand. I don't think it's a huge departure. It's just more like nuances of like things we kinda can't do. And naturally, you guys have already started exploring that so like strokes around buttons, that's something we wanna include in our visual library which wasn't there before. And things like that. So it's not. I don't think what you guys have done is any departure of where we're\n\n193\n00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:57.789\nMichelle Villasenor: we're headed. But I just wanted to give you a little bit more insight as to kind of a focus direction, so then that can hopefully inspire. Some some styles on on your end, too.\n\n194\n00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:23.995\nBrad Taylor: Yeah, absolutely. So we'll definitely we definitely wanna see that. And I think the best way that we work is, you know, with those vision boards with the mood boards. Let us know. Cause I think that helps Louis us to understand. Like what you like, what you don't like. It's also good to see. You know what the decision process was. That's good. And so the final one cause like, Oh, why didn't you? Or why? You know, what did you like, or what didn't you like? So\n\n195\n00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:36.030\nBrad Taylor: being a part of that process will really help and whether it's, you know, keeping in that one, or move it over to here up to you. You all to decide the best you know, working.\n\n196\n00:31:36.180 --> 00:32:02.030\nBrad Taylor: But I think it's it'll be very important for us, especially that was gonna be our next thing is like, Hey, now, we need to understand like, what do you like? Right? Like we see, we see, like the cutouts of the images and the brand guideline, we can, you know, put those masks. But outside of that, what are different elements, you know. I think when we got sent over some blog pages that you know was liked, so you know just as much as we can put on there, that'd be great.\n\n197\n00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:07.276\nMichelle Villasenor: Sure. Yeah, and we can do the exercise, too, of like walking through\n\n198\n00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:28.209\nMichelle Villasenor: you know what we did. I don't know if you have anything else on the calendar or on the agenda for this meeting, but we could just kinda quickly flash, since Becca is also on this call, and she can add some color if I miss anything. But we can kinda walk you through what we pulled if that's helpful and just kinda show you.\n\n199\n00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:36.449\nBrad Taylor: Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, that's the goal of this is kind of like, here's where we are. Where are you all at? Let's now like collaborate together.\n\n200\n00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:41.659\nMichelle Villasenor: Yeah. And ideally, we'd love to keep all the styles in this in your figma that you have. And\n\n201\n00:32:41.920 --> 00:33:06.539\nMichelle Villasenor: in the beginning of the call when you said, this is the link that goes to all the assets. We are trying to consolidate a like actual destination on our Google drive that has all of the components. So it is an easy download for partners to access. So that will exist, and that is also included in our like more visual guideline that we're creating with a link out to this downloadable link. So I think we're all kind of\n\n202\n00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:17.279\nMichelle Villasenor: into the same place, which is good. Becca, do you have the link you can share with me? Because I'm on a different computer and it's not saved in my history.\n\n203\n00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.120\nMichelle Villasenor: You just slack it to me if you want.\n\n204\n00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:37.470\nbecca ray: The why the Internet is acronym.\n\n205\n00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:41.440\nMichelle Villasenor: Yeah, like white white. Now, as much as the Internet will go.\n\n206\n00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.139\nMichelle Villasenor: That's Amy.\n\n207\n00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.080\nMichelle Villasenor: Okay? Alright.\n\n208\n00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.929\nMichelle Villasenor: I don't know if I can find it.\n\n209\n00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.520\nMichelle Villasenor: Oh, thank you.\n\n210\n00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.280\nMichelle Villasenor: Okay.\n\n211\n00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:00.320\nMichelle Villasenor: Oh, my God, of course it's like, hold on!\n\n212\n00:34:01.369 --> 00:34:05.840\nMichelle Villasenor: Hold on! I get kicked out of stuff like every 2 days. Hold on.\n\n213\n00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:10.059\nMax Techera: The whole octa situation.\n\n214\n00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.799\nMax Techera: I mean to all the platforms every day.\n\n215\n00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.290\nMichelle Villasenor: I know it's nightmare.\n\n216\n00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:20.439\nBrad Taylor: It always happens right for a call. It's like, and then Google, just like, automatically, log me out just like right.\n\n217\n00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:20.900\nMichelle Villasenor: Oh! Like.\n\n218\n00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.013\nBrad Taylor: Like writing an email. I'm like, really thought that was a great time. Oh, you're AI, and you can't.\n\n219\n00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:29.399\nMichelle Villasenor: Computer restarts. And it's like you need a reboot\n\n220\n00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.090\nMichelle Villasenor: and authenticator. Alright, hold on.\n\n221\n00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.112\nBrad Taylor: I recently had my windows machine just literally restart right in the middle of a podcast.\n\n222\n00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.620\nMichelle Villasenor: Oh no!\n\n223\n00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.960\nBrad Taylor: Oh!\n\n224\n00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:51.159\nMichelle Villasenor: My God! Well done!\n\n225\n00:34:52.689 --> 00:34:54.529\nMichelle Villasenor: 8, 3, 7\n\n226\n00:35:00.359 --> 00:35:01.639\nMichelle Villasenor: have no idea.\n\n227\n00:35:03.909 --> 00:35:05.199\nMichelle Villasenor: Oh, here we go.\n\n228\n00:35:19.239 --> 00:35:19.939\nMichelle Villasenor: Yes.\n\n229\n00:35:28.479 --> 00:35:47.137\nMichelle Villasenor: okay. And Becca feel free to like, jump in and interrupt if I'm missing anything. But basically we got together the other day and just kinda looked at all the creative that we did from like a marketing perspective. So this includes any like organic, social paid landing page designs, any sort of\n\n230\n00:35:47.669 --> 00:35:54.299\nMichelle Villasenor: branded or partnership initiatives which it could be like conferences or announcements or things like that.\n\n231\n00:35:54.429 --> 00:36:10.009\nMichelle Villasenor: So we just kinda dumped everything in one place. So we looked at a 3 60 like brand campaign that we did. We were looking at ads and organic posts like kind of looking at categories, and how we were representing certain categories across\n\n232\n00:36:10.009 --> 00:36:33.969\nMichelle Villasenor: our channels. And then we, you know, Asl app stores, screens, and also announcements on Linkedin and then landing pages. So from there we kind of started pulling things out and categorizing visually. So seeing that there was just kind of this, these bold color washes that we were using really bright using the bright, bold colors.\n\n233\n00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:38.559\nMichelle Villasenor: gradations like, when did they show up? How did we use them?\n\n234\n00:36:39.379 --> 00:36:55.359\nMichelle Villasenor: What we're calling the pill which I think you guys call tags? Like those little these little guys things that have just like a lot of white space, negative space just like clean this like thread, visual device.\n\n235\n00:36:55.569 --> 00:37:19.473\nMichelle Villasenor: the container, which is like the the Rectangle square. However, you want it to like show up. Just so. You know. The container was inspired by like the actual articles that you see in the app, so like the the vis, the image container, and seeing if we can use that both on and off the app and using that as a visual device. So like this, like rounded corner,\n\n236\n00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:30.839\nMichelle Villasenor: mechanism. And so from there we just kinda started pulling to see like, where was where was like a cohesive visual language and what wasn't making sense\n\n237\n00:37:30.839 --> 00:37:37.049\nMichelle Villasenor: to us. And so we came to this little mood board here\n\n238\n00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:39.939\nMichelle Villasenor: where we liked this\n\n239\n00:37:40.189 --> 00:38:00.319\nMichelle Villasenor: balance of negative space with the use of containers, both solid colors without strokes and strokes. Obviously, like design, can change, based off of whatever the used cases when we incorporated illustrations, we liked them to be a little bit done in a\n\n240\n00:38:00.519 --> 00:38:30.059\nMichelle Villasenor: I guess a cleaner way where it's on a lighter background versus a a darker background. Just so they pop more and kind of have a more of a moment, and we also felt that it should be more purposeful whenever we include included the illustrations versus illustrations everywhere, so that might be more of like an icon based illustration system with one off kind of moments like these that can kind of help tell a visual story when gradient showed up that kind of represents\n\n241\n00:38:30.396 --> 00:38:43.533\nMichelle Villasenor: like a spectrum of information. So here in this, like kind of blue to purple to red, is is really speaking to politics and showing kind of the range of information from left to right, and everything in between.\n\n242\n00:38:43.929 --> 00:39:07.109\nMichelle Villasenor: And then here on the bottom left, where it's like the green to blue gradient. That's also showing, like we have a range of information and a range of topics. That is all. In one place. When we talk about the container, we felt that it's important if there's multiple containers together. So let's say on the landing page, if there's\n\n243\n00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:18.909\nMichelle Villasenor: maybe a carousel maybe showing like I don't know if there's ever like image. I think there was one layout that you guys had where there was a couple of images kind of next to each other, just making sure that there was this like\n\n244\n00:39:18.909 --> 00:39:43.649\nMichelle Villasenor: nice balance, negative spaces between everything. If we used a big container, how does that bleed? When does it? W. Does it make sense when it's like taking up full? art boards, things like that. So this kind of felt like it was the right balance of that push and pull between like using the container to negative space to gradation. I don't know if Becky, you wanna add anything else\n\n245\n00:39:44.029 --> 00:39:45.329\nMichelle Villasenor: on that.\n\n246\n00:39:45.500 --> 00:40:00.258\nbecca ray: Yeah, I think I think specifically to some topics or themes that we're seeing that came through in this exploration. We did. That will be relevant with kind of tweaking the component system. You all build the stuff like.\n\n247\n00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:13.649\nbecca ray: you know. I think previously we had a lot of different styles happening everywhere. We have, like some drop shot at some places, and and then we got a little bit more flat in some places, and I think we're kind of leaning more into that flat world? Some moments like that.\n\n248\n00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:22.719\nbecca ray: and then things like Michelle. If you zoom in on the article one that's about the mother. Yeah.\n\n249\n00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:29.719\nbecca ray: okay, so even some like little micro moments like that tag. So this in this case is just showing\n\n250\n00:40:30.332 --> 00:40:57.700\nbecca ray: like the publisher. So maybe we can get some clues from almost like that to kind of pull back into the Ui elements that you guys are building in the toolkit so that can maybe fit back into the Adams. And how we kind of like create color or adding consistencies in that world. So I think there's some moments from this that we can kind of feed back in, or even that example below that\n\n251\n00:40:58.237 --> 00:41:09.342\nbecca ray: where we do have, like the fully rounded pearls that are a little bit like puffier. Is there another place where that makes sense for feeding that back into the ui for the website?\n\n252\n00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:35.170\nMichelle Villasenor: Yeah. And what we're playing around with, too, is like, when these little this shape container showed up. It was when it was directly related to an article. So this mimics the ui in the app of like, how they tag in in the app currently. And so we were thinking, if there was like a repo on organic social about a particular article. Then this\n\n253\n00:41:35.170 --> 00:42:04.360\nMichelle Villasenor: more squared, rounded, cornered tag would show up. But if we talked about like high level topics or lists, or like anything that just felt a little bit unrelated, more like smart news. The brand than these more circular pills would show up. So it's like macro. Smart news, the brand micro article. Just so. It kinda had a little bit more of a 1 to one relationship with, like. The experience in in the app.\n\n254\n00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:23.360\nbecca ray: Yeah. And then I think, also, just kind of at like a yeah, like this zoomed out level. Just how colors coming into play where we've got this kind of like, I think it's our surface color is most often the heavily used color color.\n\n255\n00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:38.770\nbecca ray: So maybe there's moments where we decide to to lean into some of the different colors, because right now it seems like they might be in more of these like lighter shades. In that component library that you guys will so maybe we can start to just kind of like.\n\n256\n00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.820\nbecca ray: find this happy medium between how color is coming into play.\n\n257\n00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:50.409\nMichelle Villasenor: Yeah. And what we were talking about to in our call was, I know, blue and green were kind of\n\n258\n00:42:50.410 --> 00:43:15.359\nMichelle Villasenor: emerging as our primary colors out of the whole group. But based off of this exercise, we felt that the orange also added like a nice balance, and then we saw red is more of like an alert color, or like a notification color. So I think, thinking about that, too, of like blue, green, and orange being kind of like the core trio colors which you guys naturally already\n\n259\n00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:28.659\nMichelle Villasenor: pulled out and red being an alert. And then we also are going to be introducing a purple that feels like it's part of this color ecosystem. So then it can kind of help.\n\n260\n00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:55.130\nMichelle Villasenor: That would also be like a tertiary color that will introduce. But we see that more. When talking about like politics. I don't. I doubt you guys will have like political, specific things in on the website. But just so you're aware, like the way we're gonna probably talk about it and customer facing content. If we do talk about politics, will you show this gradation, or, you know, use purple just so we can show that we're like this\n\n261\n00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.349\nMichelle Villasenor: balanced new source.\n\n262\n00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.649\nMichelle Villasenor: So those are kind of like the nuances that we\n\n263\n00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:22.850\nMichelle Villasenor: kinda came to on our call the other day. Obviously, this brand guideline work and the branding work that we did is very fresh. So I just feel like everything that we've done to date was definitely an exploration. And I think, it's heading in this like nice, clean, approachable, but friendly.\n\n264\n00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:40.060\nMichelle Villasenor: what direction? Oh, one other thing we did talk about is typography. We were talking about using the serif when on like the website. And anything that speaks about the brand is like the headline. It would be like everything, serif.\n\n265\n00:44:40.060 --> 00:45:03.610\nMichelle Villasenor: And then when it gets a little bit more further down the funnel like, maybe on organic, social, or maybe like an email, maybe a notification and app. That's when you start getting the sans serif. So we would recommend doing the the serif as kind of a headline typeface for for the website, and using the sansera as a secondary supporter.\n\n266\n00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:04.820\nMichelle Villasenor: which I believe.\n\n267\n00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:06.209\nMax Techera: So you only have one\n\n268\n00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:11.420\nMax Techera: like just the one title per page where it's better if and then everything else is just.\n\n269\n00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:12.760\nMichelle Villasenor: Yeah.\n\n270\n00:45:13.371 --> 00:45:21.629\nMax Techera: I wonder just what you were talking before about, like how you have identified shapes, and how the outlines work in information about like the brand versus\n\n271\n00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.169\nMax Techera: news. Do you find that happens as well with callers?\n\n272\n00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:27.849\nMax Techera: You say it's more.\n\n273\n00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:29.610\nMax Techera: not as much.\n\n274\n00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:54.599\nMichelle Villasenor: Not as much. I think we're trying to get away. I think historically, smart news has associated categories with the colors that are in the tabs so like, let's I don't remember off the top of my head, but I think oh, here's an example so like politics is green here, and so a lot of material they would do in their content would be green and when you have a limited color palette, it just gets really complex very quickly. You can't just\n\n275\n00:45:54.600 --> 00:46:02.419\nMichelle Villasenor: like have every color, because then politics and then entertainment become the same color. So it just gets a little tricky.\n\n276\n00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:15.180\nMichelle Villasenor: I think, for us, politics would be the only category that will introduce purple to just to kind of visually represent like a blend but everything else will relatively\n\n277\n00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:20.440\nMichelle Villasenor: maintain in that, you know a mix of the greens, blues, and oranges.\n\n278\n00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:32.730\nMax Techera: This is just to get into the mindset of what what you guys are kind of thinking of, because once we get these into content full side, like you have all of these options to choose. So you want.\n\n279\n00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:33.090\nMichelle Villasenor: Yeah.\n\n280\n00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:37.719\nMax Techera: Adding new blogs or creating new heroes, basically that you can choose that at that moment.\n\n281\n00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:38.320\nMichelle Villasenor: Yeah.\n\n282\n00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.297\nMax Techera: This looks great. This is very, very useful.\n\n283\n00:46:42.690 --> 00:47:03.187\nMichelle Villasenor: Good. Do you want me to send? Obviously, we're gonna continue to refine it on our side. But I can shoot a screenshot of this over to you. Just so you can use as a visual reference and guide cause we're we're gonna we're using this mood board here as a guide internally right now as well. And also sharing it to like our our creative agency.\n\n284\n00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:25.390\nMichelle Villasenor: but yeah, if you have any other questions, or if you're like, what was the thinking behind this like? Feel free to to reach out, and we'll be happy to talk through it, cause in all honesty. We're, you know, we're still trying to really define it right now, and I know we had some rough general notes about like do's and don'ts based off of our conversation the other day.\n\n285\n00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:26.370\nBrad Taylor: Home.\n\n286\n00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:41.439\nBrad Taylor: Yeah, I mean, this is great. This is definitely exactly where we wanted to go next, or is like, you know, get that vision board out there seems like a lot of thoughts gone into, you know, with negative spacing color usage in particular topics. So\n\n287\n00:47:41.788 --> 00:47:52.399\nBrad Taylor: these are all great information to know, especially when we talk talking about topic, usage and stuff like that like, how do we make it? So that you know you have politics as green right now. You wanna make it purple.\n\n288\n00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:58.039\nBrad Taylor: hey? Maybe it's you know, something else in the future. How do we make it? So that it's just there, and you have to go back and change everything.\n\n289\n00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.163\nBrad Taylor: Yeah. So we'll we'll make sure that we\n\n290\n00:48:00.702 --> 00:48:06.510\nBrad Taylor: if they're gonna be tightly tied to that that's good information to have. I did notice that. Well, I mean it was a\n\n291\n00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:27.029\nBrad Taylor: semi recent. But how often do you all? And what part of the brand is making sure that the the screenshots of the app have up to date news cause I was just realizing, like, if it has like out of date news. It might seem kind of like old and outdated. Now, I feel like that's would be like a heavy lift to kinda always be Updating it with at least somewhat recent news.\n\n292\n00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.300\nMichelle Villasenor: Yeah, is that.\n\n293\n00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:32.780\nBrad Taylor: Go into the brand, or in the kind of imagery, and when you think of the app.\n\n294\n00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:41.329\nMichelle Villasenor: Yeah, typically from regarding the land or the site. Historically, we haven't been able to touch any updates so like\n\n295\n00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:50.290\nMichelle Villasenor: that hasn't been able to get updated. When it comes to the app store. I know we refresh the app store like every month.\n\n296\n00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:51.810\nBrad Taylor: Right? Okay.\n\n297\n00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:55.159\nMichelle Villasenor: We try to keep it pretty relevant.\n\n298\n00:48:55.160 --> 00:49:03.089\nBrad Taylor: Yeah, okay? So then we can, yeah, so yeah, we definitely wanna have kind of maybe in the process of the web matches the app store. Yeah.\n\n299\n00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.675\nBrad Taylor: Yeah,\n\n300\n00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:13.400\nBrad Taylor: it's just from my as consumer. When I see an app with old screenshots, I assume that hasn't been updated. I just do.\n\n301\n00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.180\nMichelle Villasenor: That.\n\n302\n00:49:14.462 --> 00:49:21.529\nBrad Taylor: So that's I was like, Oh, that could be a when I saw I was like, Oh, those are actually really recent. So\n\n303\n00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:22.490\nBrad Taylor: yeah,\n\n304\n00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:39.260\nBrad Taylor: okay, anything else. We can go over on this. We're gonna work. I know our action items. We're gonna get you into our figma. I think there I had to move it over to, I think when I cloned it, it cloned in my personal. For whatever reason I moved it over to Last Rab. And I'll give, you know, Max, the editing\n\n305\n00:49:39.602 --> 00:49:43.969\nBrad Taylor: capabilities so we can comment and stuff like that. We'll figure that piece out\n\n306\n00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:49.970\nBrad Taylor: you're gonna serve a screenshot or also share the that stigma with our team.\n\n307\n00:49:50.860 --> 00:50:00.905\nBrad Taylor: And then and then, yeah, I think then, our next what we'd like to do is schedule some time 2 weeks from now. Have another review session.\n\n308\n00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:24.290\nBrad Taylor: We can kinda go see where we're at the main things that we really wanna focus on are those global elements. Right now, I wouldn't get too caught up into like the individual components. Cause I think of the header, the navigation items, tech hobby colors, those types of things. We can put those in and start doing that. So that\n\n309\n00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:44.530\nBrad Taylor: you know we can start development. Those are kind of the requirements needed to start development. Then those individual pieces. Ideally, we have them finalized before we start development we we got. We all know how this goes. So we can definitely, iteratively kind of go over that. But we'll wanna make sure that we're not constantly changing it. Cause\n\n310\n00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:47.789\nBrad Taylor: once we've started development on a component like\n\n311\n00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:57.109\nBrad Taylor: that's kind of locked down at that point. Besides, like, you know, maybe there's like a weird, spacing thing that we didn't account for in the figma. Of course there's bugs, but, like\n\n312\n00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:07.519\nBrad Taylor: major changes should be finalized. Doesn't mean we can't change it after launch. But when we start development on a component we like, save that's locked in for at least to launch.\n\n313\n00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.469\nMax Techera: Exactly. That's why like this next few weeks, what I would like to see is\n\n314\n00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:26.740\nMax Techera: top of the caller, usage and topography that we do an expiration in the signal like what shapes look like? What are the shapes we're going to use? What are they gonna be used for? Same thing with outlining like from that level. So then, we can agree on that, you know.\n\n315\n00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:33.390\nMax Techera: apes and outlines and containers, and so, and then transition that into buttons and arts and everything else.\n\n316\n00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:37.670\nBrad Taylor: Cool.\n\n317\n00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:50.489\nBrad Taylor: awesome. Well, I'll send a follow up email, just kind of summarizing this this talk. And we'll just if we could Ben kind of get something scheduled.\n\n318\n00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:58.380\nBrad Taylor: Well, we just go ahead and schedule 2 weeks from now and then 2 weeks from then, and we'll assume the next one's gonna be like kind of like our next.\n\n319\n00:51:58.996 --> 00:52:01.529\nBrad Taylor: You know, design. You know\n\n320\n00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:06.150\nBrad Taylor: the the global elements, then that further 2 weeks kind of be more like a\n\n321\n00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:12.609\nBrad Taylor: Hey, this is kind of we're we're we're close, maybe another thing, and then we'll then, if we need a 3rd one\n\n322\n00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.460\nBrad Taylor: sound good\n\n323\n00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:17.809\nBrad Taylor: sounds great.\n\n324\n00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:23.319\nBen Leiner: And I'm I'm about to send your emails to Michelle so that she can send access to her file to you.\n\n325\n00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:26.010\nBrad Taylor: And please\n\n326\n00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:34.873\nBrad Taylor: through slack, through whatever communication. Please communicate with us early and often and asynchronously. Don't feel like you have to wait till our next meeting.\n\n327\n00:52:35.473 --> 00:52:41.950\nBrad Taylor: That way.
